# How to handle a difficult SME

If you struggle to obtain a help from an SME, look at the below tips on how to encourage an SME to cooperate:

- **Introduce yourself** - if you contact the SME for the first time, it is good to mention: 
your name, the team you work in, what does the team do, why you contact the SME. Make sure the SME knows why you need his assistance. Make sure you contact the right person.

- **Describe the issue** - explain what information you require. Describe the context of the problem and prepare questions. Do not ask questions which you can find easily.
 
- **Set a deadline** - suggest and confirm a suitable deadline for the SME. When you set the date for the SME remember about your deadline and leave a sufficient amount of time to complete your task and for the next step;

- **Send a reminder** - if the SME does not reply to you, ask politely if he/she looked at your query. Tell the SME about the importance of the required information. If the SME does not respond, contact him/her by other communication means. Do not send too many messages.  

 - **Appreciate help** - Inform the SME how important his help was. Give the SME a credit in an employee recognition program, if applicable.

 - **Add one more here** - Because so

 - **And add another** - To make more content

 If the SME does not respond despite of the taken measures, contact people related to the field in order to find a new SME.
